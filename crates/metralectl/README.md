# metralectl

Launch [Metrale Engine](https://github.com/Metrale/metrale-inference) inference recipes
on NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10) and other local accelerators.

A recipe describes one model deployment — the checkpoint, the container image,
and the serve settings it was validated under. `metralectl` reads a recipe and
runs the `docker run` it implies.

```sh
uvx metralectl list                              # what is available
uvx metralectl show qwen3.6-35b-a3b-fp8-mtp      # what a recipe does
uvx metralectl run qwen3.6-35b-a3b-fp8-mtp       # serve it
uvx metralectl run <recipe> --print              # print the command instead
```

`uv tool install metralectl` puts `metralectl` on your PATH.

This wheel contains a self-contained Rust binary and no Python code.

**Recipes ship inside the binary.** A fresh install makes no network request to
resolve a recipe, and there is no "trusted registry" mechanism — a remote
registry can supply recipe data but can never cause a command to run. See
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/Metrale/metralectl/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
for why that matters and what it replaces.

Requires Docker to launch anything; `list`, `show`, and `run --print` work
without it. Linux, macOS and Windows — on Windows the agent is supervised by
a Task Scheduler task at logon rather than a service, because a service runs
in session 0 and cannot reach Docker Desktop's per-user named pipe.
